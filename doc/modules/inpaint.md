## General Information about Inpainting

*   Inpainting modules are used to fill in masked regions of an image, often to remove text or other unwanted elements and reconstruct the background.
*   **AOT Inpainter** is sourced from the [manga-image-translator](https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator) project.
*   **Lama Inpainters** (`lama_large_512px`, `lama_mpe`) are fine-tuned models based on the [LaMa](https://github.com/advimman/lama) inpainting technique.
*   **PatchMatch Inpainter** utilizes a modified version of the [PatchMatch algorithm](https://github.com/vacancy/PyPatchMatch) from [PyPatchMatch](https://github.com/vacancy/PyPatchMatch), adapted by [dmMaze](https://github.com/dmMaze/PyPatchMatchInpaint).

## Available Inpainting Modules

### AOT Inpainter

*   **Source:** [manga-image-translator](https://github.com/zyddnys/manga-image-translator) project.
*   **Technology:**  Based on the AOT-GAN architecture (Adaptive Operation Transformer Generative Adversarial Network).
*   **Suitable for:** General inpainting tasks, potentially optimized for manga/anime style images.

**Settings Fields:**

*   **inpaint_size:** Specifies the processing size for the inpainting model. Available options may include: `512`, `768`, `1024`, `1536`, `2048`. Larger sizes may offer better inpainting quality but require more computational resources.
*   **device:** Choose between `CPU` or `CUDA` for processing. `CUDA` is recommended for faster inpainting if a compatible NVIDIA GPU is available.

### Lama Inpainters (lama\_large\_512px, lama\_mpe)

*   **Technology:** Based on the [LaMa (Large Mask Inpainting)](https://github.com/advimman/lama) model architecture.
*   **Characteristics:** Lama models are known for their ability to handle large and irregular masks effectively.

#### lama\_large\_512px

*   **Model Size:** "Large" model variant.
*   **Input Size:** Optimized for input images around 512x512 pixels. While it can handle larger images, performance and quality might be best around this size.
*   **Available Inpaint Sizes:** `512`, `768`, `1024`, `1536`, `2048`.

**Settings Fields:**

*   **inpaint_size:** Specifies the processing size. Options: `512`, `768`, `1024`, `1536`, `2048`.
*   **device:** Choose `CPU` or `CUDA`.
*   **precision:** Allows selecting the numerical precision for computation. Options might include `bf16` (BFloat16), `fp16` (Float16), `fp32` (Float32). Lower precision like `bf16` or `fp16` can speed up processing and reduce memory usage, especially on GPUs with Tensor Cores, but may slightly impact accuracy. `fp32` offers the highest precision but is generally slower and more memory-intensive.

#### lama\_mpe

*   **Model Variant:** "MPE" likely refers to a specific fine-tuning or variant of the LaMa model, potentially optimized for a different type of image or mask.  *(Further details needed on "MPE" specifics)*
*   **Available Inpaint Sizes:** `512`, `768`, `1024`, `1536`, `2048`.

**Settings Fields:**

*   **inpaint_size:** Specifies the processing size. Options: `512`, `768`, `1024`, `1536`, `2048`.
*   **device:** Choose `CPU` or `CUDA`.

### PatchMatch Inpainter

*   **Algorithm:** [PatchMatch](https://github.com/vacancy/PyPatchMatch) algorithm, using a modified version [PyPatchMatchInpaint](https://github.com/dmMaze/PyPatchMatchInpaint).
*   **Technology:**  A non-learning based algorithm that excels at fast, context-aware image completion by finding and transferring similar patches from unmasked regions to the masked area.
*   **Characteristics:** Generally faster than deep learning-based methods, especially for larger images, but may be less effective at hallucinating completely new content or handling complex semantic inpainting.
*   **Suitable for:** Filling in relatively simple or texture-based areas, extending existing patterns, and when speed is prioritized.

**Settings Fields:**

*   No specific settings are listed for PatchMatch in the provided context. PatchMatch parameters are usually algorithm-specific and may be controlled internally or through more advanced, less exposed settings.

### OpenCV- телеа Inpainter

*   **Technology:** Utilizes inpainting methods available within the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library).
*   **Characteristics:** OpenCV inpainting methods are generally CPU-based and offer basic inpainting capabilities. `OpenCV-tela` is known for texture synthesis-based inpainting.
*   **Suitable for:**  Quick and basic inpainting, potentially for less demanding tasks or as a fallback option.

**Settings Fields:**

*   No specific settings are listed for OpenCV-tela inpainter in the provided context. OpenCV inpainting functions typically have limited adjustable parameters.
