## LLM (Large Language Models)

*Includes ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Text Generation WebUI, Sakura, and others.*

#### ChatGPT

For detailed setup instructions and using other OpenAI-compatible APIs, please refer to this [Discussion(We'll write soon.)](link-to-discussion-about-chatgpt-setup-here). *(Please replace 'link-to-discussion-about-chatgpt-setup-here' with the actual link to a relevant discussion about ChatGPT setup and alternative APIs)*

**Settings Fields:**

*   **api key:** API Key for accessing the OpenAI API. You need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform ([https://platform.openai.com/playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)).
*   **model:** Model selection. Choose the desired OpenAI model from the dropdown list. Available options include: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt3`, `gpt35-turbo`, `gpt4`. `gpt-4o` is recommended for the best performance.
*   **3rd party api url:** 3rd party API URL (Endpoint).  If you are using a third-party OpenAI-compatible API, enter its URL here. Leave blank to use the official OpenAI API endpoint (`https://api.openai.com/v1`).
*   **override model:** Override Model.  Optionally, specify a model name here to override the selected model. This is useful for testing specific models or using models not listed in the dropdown.
*   **max tokens:** Maximum tokens.  Sets the maximum number of tokens for the response from the API.
*   **temperature:** Temperature. Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values (e.g., 0.7) make the output more random and creative, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more focused and deterministic.
*   **top p:** Top P.  Another way to control the randomness of the output, similar to temperature.

#### ChatGPT (Experimental)

For detailed setup instructions and using other OpenAI-compatible APIs, please refer to this [Discussion(We'll write soon.)](link-to-discussion-about-chatgpt-exp-setup-here). *(Please replace 'link-to-discussion-about-chatgpt-exp-setup-here' with the actual link to a relevant discussion about ChatGPT (Experimental) setup and alternative APIs)*

*   This is another version of the OpenAI-compatible translator. It may require more tokens to produce results, but it could be more accurate and reliable.
*   Two versions of OpenAI API-compatible translators are supported, working with official or third-party LLM providers, requiring configuration in the settings panel:
    *   The non-suffix version (ChatGPT) consumes fewer tokens but has slightly weaker sentence splitting stability, which may cause issues with long text translations.
    *   The 'exp' suffix version (ChatGPT (Experimental)) uses more tokens but has better stability and includes "jailbreaking" in the Prompt, making it suitable for long text translations.

**Settings Fields:**

*   **api key:** API Key for accessing the OpenAI API. You need to obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform ([https://platform.openai.com/playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)).
*   **model:** Model selection. Choose the desired OpenAI model from the dropdown list. Available options include: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4o-mini`. `gpt-4o` is recommended for the best performance.
*   **3rd party api url:** 3rd party API URL (Endpoint).  If you are using a third-party OpenAI-compatible API, enter its URL here. Leave blank to use the official OpenAI API endpoint (`https://api.openai.com/v1`).
*   **override model:** Override Model.  Optionally, specify a model name here to override the selected model. This is useful for testing specific models or using models not listed in the dropdown.
*   **max tokens:** Maximum tokens.  Sets the maximum number of tokens for the response from the API.
*   **temperature:** Temperature. Controls the randomness of the output. Higher values (e.g., 0.7) make the output more random and creative, while lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more focused and deterministic.
*   **top p:** Top P.  Another way to control the randomness of the output, similar to temperature.


#### Text Generation WebUI (TGW)

This module is recommended only for users who can easily set up their own [TGW](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) server. If you cannot, please use other translation methods.

#### Sakura

**Sakura-13B-Galgame: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SakuraLLM/Sakura-13B-Galgame)**

*   When running locally on a single device and encountering crashes due to VRAM OOM (Out Of Memory), it is recommended to enable ```low vram mode``` in the settings panel (enabled by default).

**Settings Fields:**

*   **low vram mode:** Low VRAM mode. If checked (true), the Sakura module will use less video memory.
*   **api baseurl:** API base URL to access the Sakura server. Default is `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/`. Change this if your Sakura server is running on a different address or port.
*   **dict path:** Dictionary path for Sakura. Improves translation quality.
*   **version:** Model version for Sakura. Choose from the list of available versions.
*   **retry attempts:** Retry attempts in case of an error.
*   **timeout:** Timeout for server response in milliseconds.
*   **max tokens:** Maximum tokens in the response. Limits the length of the translation.
*   **repeat detect threshold:** Repeat detection threshold. Decoding algorithm parameter.
*   **force apply dict:** Force apply dictionary.
*   **do enlarge small kana:** Enlarge small kana. Option for the Japanese language.

### LLM (General Module)

Temporary module. Essentially carries the functionality of ChatGPT, but with a preset for Google. Created as a temporary solution until a clear and working guide is written on how to use it within ChatGPT and ChatGPT (Experimental), and until proxy support is added.
